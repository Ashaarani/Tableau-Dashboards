Logistics and Transportation Dashboard
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard designed to provide insights into logistics and transportation performance across various metrics. The dashboard includes visualizations that track order status, inventory to sales trends, loading times, damaged items, and delivery performance by location and shipment mode. This project demonstrates the use of data visualization techniques to analyze and communicate key metrics in a clear and actionable format.
